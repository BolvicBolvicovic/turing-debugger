# The Turing Debugger

This project has two goals:

- Give a practical tool to debug programs created for the Turing Machine I built.
- Take my NodeJs knowledge to a new level.

# Features

- Breakpoints
- Stepper
- Overwrite data
- Vizualiser

# Plan

- [ ] Run the program passed as argument.
- [ ] Connect to the program via an http server (the Turing Machine would run in a special debug mode).
- [ ] Being able to add breakpoints, run the program and resume the program.
- [ ] Being able to step forward (and possibly backward)
- [ ] Being able to overwrite data from a whole transition to the read/written value.
- [ ] Having a nice vizualisation tool.
